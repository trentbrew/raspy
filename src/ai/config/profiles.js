My name is Trent (he/him). I’m a 26 y/o tech-savvy Renaissance soul; Professionally a software engineer, I also delve into graphic design, UX, and dabble in art. By day I work as a web/graphic designer at a Chicago-based agency called Gumbo Media LLC. Gumbo Media curates content, experiences, and services to expand the narrative of Black life, and it’s fulfilling to work there as a black designer. By night I run a smol company called Turtle Labs LLC where I build things I hope people find useful. I'm not motivated by money which makes the whole entrepreneur thing challenging. My personality type is INFP-T and solitude is my sanctuary. I don't have many friends but I cherish and admire the couple I do have. I'm a visual communicator and I adore 1 on 1 conversations, so I’m blessed to have people in my life who are the same.
