### UX Features That Would Benefit All User Types

1. **Adaptive Prompt Suggestions**: Based on the page’s structure, offer prompt suggestions that adapt to what’s available. For instance, on a product page, suggest prompts like *“Get product details”*, *“Get reviews”*, etc.
2. **Feedback Loop**: After each query, show a preview of the extracted data with an option to refine or correct it. If the data doesn’t look right, the user can modify the query or see what fields were pulled.
3. **Saved Queries for Quick Access**: Let users save queries by page type or domain (e.g., “Amazon product details”) to quickly re-run them when needed.
4. **Batch and Automation Options**: For power users, offer batching options to repeat a query on multiple pages or automate scraping across similar pages (useful for e-commerce, news, and social media).
5. **Interactive “Refine Query” Feature**: If the user doesn’t get the exact data they want, let them refine the query interactively, perhaps by highlighting elements on the page or rephrasing the prompt.
6. **Privacy and Ethics Notices**: Remind users of data-use ethics, especially when scraping from social platforms or forums. This not only keeps things above board but also builds trust with users who care about responsible data practices.

### Summary

Designing for various user journeys will help you build a robust and versatile tool. You could start by targeting power users with clearly defined goals (e.g., data analysts and researchers) since they’ll likely see immediate value and give specific feedback. As you refine the UX, make it more intuitive for casual users who want quick answers without deep technical knowledge.

**Overall UX Guiding Principle**: The core UX should make it easy to turn natural language queries into structured data with minimal steps. The tool should offer intelligent suggestions, flexible data formats, and refinement options while keeping the interface clean and focused.

Building around these user journeys can ensure you create a tool that not only stands out but genuinely meets the needs of a diverse user base. Exciting times ahead for this project!
