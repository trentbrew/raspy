# Raspy: Natural Language Web Data Extraction Tool (Chrome Extension)

## Project Vision

This project aims to create a versatile and user-friendly tool for extracting structured data from web pages using natural language queries. By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, the tool will simplify the process of web scraping, making it accessible to users with varying technical backgrounds. The goal is to provide a seamless experience for extracting data, whether through a browser extension, a standalone web app, or a hybrid approach.

## Key Features

### Natural Language Queries
Users can input queries in plain English to extract specific data from web pages. For example, "Get all product names and prices from this page" or "Extract article titles and authors from this site."

### Browser Extension
The browser extension offers quick, on-the-go data extraction directly within the user's browsing context. It provides:
- Seamless web integration
- Context awareness to interpret page structure
- Quick accessibility via toolbar icons or right-click menus
- User-friendly scraping with visual element selection

### Standalone Web App
The web app provides a more robust interface for advanced data handling and processing. It includes:
- Full interface flexibility for complex UIs
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Account-based features for saving queries and managing settings
- Backend processing for large datasets
- Real-time collaboration possibilities

### Hybrid Approach
Combining the strengths of both the extension and the web app, the hybrid approach offers:
- Basic queries handled within the extension
- Advanced queries and batch processing in the web app
- Seamless workflow between the extension and the web app
- Data syncing for a unified experience

## User Journeys

### Researchers and Academics
- **Goal**: Extract data for studies and analysis.
- **Example**: "Get remote work policies from the top 20 tech companies."
- **Value**: Saves time and effort compared to manual scraping.

### Business Intelligence and Market Analysis
- **Goal**: Track competitor pricing and inventory.
- **Example**: "List all product names, prices, and availability from competitor website X."
- **Value**: Provides easy competitive intelligence gathering.

### Content Creators and Journalists
- **Goal**: Gather sources for articles.
- **Example**: "Get titles, authors, and publication dates of the 10 most recent AI research papers from Journal X."
- **Value**: Augments research and writing processes.

### Personal Knowledge Management
- **Goal**: Import information into personal databases.
- **Example**: "Extract all section headings and links from Wikipedia page X."
- **Value**: Simplifies gathering web-based information.

### Small Business Owners and Entrepreneurs
- **Goal**: Monitor review scores and customer sentiment.
- **Example**: "Get all reviews with ratings and timestamp for my business on Yelp, Google, and Facebook."
- **Value**: Easy data collection for analysis without technical expertise.

## Technical Considerations

### JSONML for DOM Queries
Using JSONML to represent HTML as JSON simplifies DOM queries and manipulation in JavaScript. This format is compact, well-defined, and suitable for transforming HTML/XML to JSONML, making it easier to work with in the tool.

### Existing Solutions
While there are existing tools like Diffbot, Import.io, and Scraper API, this project differentiates itself by focusing on:
- Advanced natural language query capabilities
- Seamless and intuitive user experience
- Expanded use cases beyond data extraction
- Open-source, community-driven approach

## Conclusion

This natural language web data extraction tool aims to revolutionize the way users interact with web data. By providing a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly solution, it caters to a wide range of user needs, from casual data gathering to advanced research and analysis. The hybrid approach ensures that users can enjoy the best of both worlds, with quick, in-context data extraction and robust, backend-powered processing.
